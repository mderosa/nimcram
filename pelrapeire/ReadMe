building a jar
- download the project from git into HOKULEA_HOME
- from HOKULEA_HOME type the command 'lein deps' to create and populate a lib folder (you will have to manually download  org/clojure/contrib/complete-1.3.0-alpha1-bin.jar from clojars (http://clojars.org/), rename it to complete-1.3.0-alpha1.jar, and add it to your maven repository manually, sorry)
- from HOKULEA_HOME type the command 'lein jar'

testing 
- unit tests are run with the command 'lein test' (unfortunately this 
command will also run the integration tests at the moment so if you 
do run this command expect to get 4 failures)
- integration tests are run with the command 'lein test :integration'
  (reqire a integration database)
- both unit and integration tests can be run with the command 'lein test :all'

running the application
- download the project from git into HOKULEA_HOME
- from HOKULEA_HOME type the command 'lein deps' (see 'building a jar' above) to create and populate a lib folder
- type 'lein repl' to start a repl
- at the repl enter the commands
  > (use 'pelrapeire.core)
  > (future (start))
- you should then be able to view the application at http://localhost:8080/index
  (assuming you have a database setup)
