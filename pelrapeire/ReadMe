building a jar
- download the project from git into HOKULEA_HOME
- from HOKULEA_HOME type the command 'lein deps' to create and populate a lib folder.
  (Also if you plan on using swank to view the code you
  will have to move the swank.jar with the command 'cp ./lib/dev/swank-XXXX.jar ./lib/')
- from HOKULEA_HOME type the command 'lein jar'

testing 
- unit tests are run with the command 'lein test' (unfortunately this 
  command will also run the integration tests at the moment so if you 
  do run this command expect to get 4 failures)
- integration tests are run with the command 'lein test :integration'
  (reqire a integration database)
- both unit and integration tests can be run with the command 'lein test :all'

running the application
- download the project from git into HOKULEA_HOME
- from HOKULEA_HOME type the command 'lein deps' (see 'building a jar' above) to create and populate a lib folder
- type 'lein repl' to start a repl
- at the repl enter the commands
  > (use 'pelrapeire.core)
  > (future (start))
- you should then be able to view the application at http://localhost:8080/index
  (In order to successfully run the application you must have a database set up.  To set up 
  a database see the ReadMe file in the picominmin-db subdirectory)
